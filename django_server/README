GOTCHAS

Memory: you'll need to provide > 1GB of memory for your instance/VM to install django-twilio due to a memory bug with the package 'phonenumbers'. 2GB seems sufficient.

Multiple instances: careful of running multiple instances of the same program connected to the same MQTT broker!  You'll easily create cascading duplicates as each instance escalates / responds to messages.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

You'll need to use `cf set-env` to define the following env vars:

TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
