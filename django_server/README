SETUP

If you are running the app locally, run `setup.sh` on your Debian-based Linux platform (uses apt-get, Ubuntu works too).  If using BlueMix, or some other PaaS, you'll need to configure the appropriate services, currently:
    - postgresql
    - rabbitMQ (for celery)
    - Twilio

Run setup_db.sh the first time you create a fresh app (including creating a new DB service on BlueMix!) to get the whole DB setup without user interaction.

GOTCHAS

Memory: you'll need to provide > 1GB of memory for your instance/VM to install django-twilio due to a memory bug with the package 'phonenumbers'. 2GB seems sufficient.

Multiple instances: careful of running multiple instances of the same program connected to the same MQTT broker!  You'll easily create cascading duplicates as each instance escalates / responds to messages.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

You'll need to use `cf set-env` to define the following env vars:

TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
